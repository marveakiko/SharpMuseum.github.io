     <p>This is Japan's first Crystal Radio.</p>
     <p>Following the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, Tokuji restarted business in Osaka, where he saw a future in the field of radio. </p>
     <p>In April 1925, he and his associates made history as they succeeded in assembling Japan's very first crystal radio.</p>
     <p>The sound quality was good but the volume was low, so people had to use headphones to listen to the radio.</p>
